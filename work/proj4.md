brief:
  "I worked closely with GOSH PR a london based marketing agency to create a simple yet beautiful website running on WordPress."

  "In the Spring of 2012, I was asked to customised 'OnBrand' a North Plains asset management tool for BBC Marketing and Assets. Working for 
  a big household name such as BBC, it was clear from the start to my collegue and I, that we needed to deliver something worthy."
