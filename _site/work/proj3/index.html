        <h5>The Brief</h5>
        <p>Working on tight deadline during winter festives, it was bound to bring tears and drama, but with a strong team at NP, FutureBrand, the company behind OLT, knew they could rely on us for a redesign. The main key here was to showcase events without confusing the visitor and provide a clear guideline on how to use Solr for taxonomy. And in the end, it all came together beautifully just in time for New Year Eve.</p>

        <h5>The results</h5>
        <p>In the Spring of 2012, I was asked to customised 'OnBrand' a North Plains asset management tool for BBC Marketing and Assets. Working for a big household name such as BBC, it was clear from the start to my collegue and I, that we needed to deliver something worthy.</p>
