        <h5>The Brief</h5>
        <p>Ronnie Wood, a former member of 'Faces' and international rock band. While working at theTin Ltd, I was asked to theme WordPress for what was to become Ronnie Wood blog and also showcasing his arts work and music.</p>

        <h5>The results</h5>
        <p>In the Spring of 2012, I was asked to customised 'OnBrand' a North Plains asset management tool for BBC Marketing and Assets. Working for a big household name such as BBC, it was clear from the start to my collegue and I, that we needed to deliver something worthy.</p>
